# Description: 

Made at BoilerMake 2014 by Chris Chan and William Xie.

The price of a stock is based on a large amount of data. At BoilerMake, we decided to try to look into the relationship between online new articles and the volume of stock. Leveraging the Bloomberg API, we developed a web application that scrapes large collections of relevant news articles about a company, runs sentiment analysis on the collection of articles, and displays a visualization of the correlation between the sentiment and the volume of stock. Our goal was to offer a new dimension and insight into stocks from banking analysts to casual traders.
